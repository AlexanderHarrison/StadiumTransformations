# m-ex Stadium Transformation Stages

Individual stages for each stadium transformation.

Please note that the water transformation is a little buggy:
  - The windmill does not move or have collision.
  - The water does not appear.
  - Some of the platforms don't render.
I can try to fix these if necessary, but it could be difficult.

## How to install

1. Download [mexTool](https://github.com/akaneia/mexTool).
2. Open mexTool and load a new vanilla iso file that you will be modifying.
3. Install the m-ex stuff if it gives you a popup.
4. Go to the "Filesystem" tab, then right click on "root" and import the "GrPs-fire.usd" file. Repeat for the other transformations.
5. Go to the "Stages" tab, then import the "PSFire.zip" file. Repeat for the other transformations.
6. Go to the "Menus" tab, then, for each transformation:
  - Click "+" to add a new icon.
  - Move the icon to wherever you want it.
  - Change the icon and name to whatever you want.
  - Set the "Stage" to "PSFire" or which ever transformation you want.
7. File->Save and let m-ex rebuild if it wants to.
8. Enjoy! Feel free to DM me in my [discord](https://discord.gg/2Khb8CVP7A) if you run into issues.
